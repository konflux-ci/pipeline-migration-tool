# Pipeline Migration Tool

A migration tool does migrations for Konflux pipelines.

## Run tests

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
tox
```

## Local test by running the migration tool

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .

# Log into a registry
podman login quay.io

# Push sample task bundles to your image repositories
# For example, the following set will result in bundles like quay.io/account_name/task-clone
export IMAGE_NS=quay.io/account_name

# Enable local test in order to work with images from arbitrary image organization.
export PMT_LOCAL_TEST=on

# Specify an alternative registry authentication file
export REGISTRY_AUTH_JSON=path/to/auth.json

# build and push sample task bundles task-clone and task-tests.
bash ./hack/local-test/run.sh build-and-push

# Make sure the image repositories are public, especially if you did not create them before running the above command.
# Sample Renovate upgrades data is written into file /tmp/pmt-upgrades-data.txt

# Run the migration tool
pipeline-migration-tool -u "$(cat /tmp/pmt-upgrades-data.txt)"

# To remove all pushed task bundles from the remote registry
# bash ./hack/local-test/run.sh remove-task-bundles
```
