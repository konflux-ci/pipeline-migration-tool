    The upgrade range is a collection of tags pointing from the new bundle to the previous one of
    current bundle. This method handles several senariors against the tag scheme:

    * This method aims to work well with the tag scheme pushed by build-definitions CI pipeline.
      The expected tag form is ``<version>-<commit hash>``.
    * Ideally, the bundles should be built linearly version by version. However, out-of-order
      bundles started to present in bundle repositories, for example, old version task is built
      because of deprecation.
    * Transitioning to decentralized build-definitions. Some tasks have been decentralized and
      already have new tag scheme in their image repositories. Part of the repositories have single
      tag scheme, whereas others mixes two.

      The pure new tag scheme looks like (from newest to oldest):

        3.0
        sha256-123456
        sha256-345678

      Similarly, the mixed tag schemes looks like:

        3.0
        sha256-123456
        sha256-345678
        0.2
        0.2-revision_1
        0.2-revision_2

    As of writing this docstring, upgrade range is still determined based on the original tag scheme
    made by build-definitions CI pipeline, and this method tries best to not fail when possibly
    encounter the new tag scheme. For detailed information of the result range, refer to the below
    description.

    IMPORTANT: current implementation is not intended as a solution for addressing the decentralized
    task bundles.
