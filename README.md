# Pipeline Migration Tool

Pipeline migration tool is command line tool applying migrations for Konflux pipelines. It also
allows to modify Konflux build pipelines locally.

## Commands

### To apply migrations with `migrate`

Applying migrations is the major feature of pipeline-migration-tool. It auto-discovers migrations
for given task bundle upgrades and applies found migrations to build pipelines. The pipeline can be
either included in a `PipelineRun` definition as `spec.pipelineSpec` or a single `Pipeline`
defintion.

To make it work, migrations must be attached to corresponding task bundles as OCI artifacts,
typically with `oras attach`. Let's go deep dive a bit.

* If a task bundle has a migration, it must be annotated with `dev.konflux-ci.task.has-migration: true`
* A migration must be attached to the bundle with artifact type `text/x-shellscript` and annotated
  with `dev.konflux-ci.task.is-migration: true`.
* A task bundle has only one migration.
* A migration is written as a normal Bash script. Generally, it invokes `yq` to modify the pipelines.

Document [Task Migration]
(https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions/?tab=readme-ov-file#task-migration) of
konflux-ci/build-definitions describes the migrations in detail. build-definitions provides a rich
tool chain and CI for creation, validation and ensuring migrations are available to
pipeline-migration-tool.

pipeline-migration-tool is configured in Konflux Mintmaker as a Renovate post-upgrade command and
Renovate is responsible for invoke migration tool properly. Then, in general, it is unnecessary for
Konflux users to run `migrate` by themselves.

To apply migrations, run command:

```bash
cd path/to/repo
pmt migrate -u '<upgrades>'
```

`upgrades` is a JSON string encoded from a list of mappings. Each mapping includes data for a
single task bundle upgrade, for example:

```jsonc
[
  {
    "depName": "quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/task-init",
    "currentValue": "0.1",
    "currentDigest": "sha256:...",
    "newValue": "0.1",
    "newDigest": "sha256:...",
    "packageFile": ".tekton/component-name-pull.yaml",
    "parentDir": ".tekton",
    "depTypes": ["tekton-bundle"]
  },
  // ...
]
```

The field names map to the [Renovate template fields]
(https://docs.renovatebot.com/templates/#other-available-fields) directly:

* `depName`: `{{depName}}`
* `currentValue`: `{{currentValue}}`
* `currentDigest`: `{{currentDigest}}`
* `newValue`: `{{newValue}}`
* `newDigest`: `{{newDigest}}`
* `packageFile`: `{{packageFile}}`
* `parentDir`: `{{parentDir}}`
* `depTypes`: `{{depTypes}}`

To generate the list, handlebars built-in `each` helper of Renovate is used.

### Add a Konflux task to build pipeline with `add-task`

Sub-command `add-task` provides rich options to add a Konflux task to build pipelines in local
Component repositories. Let's take the task `sast-coverity-check` as an example to see a few
command usages:

* Add task with latest bundle to pipelines from inside a repository:

  ```bash
  pmt add-task sast-coverity-check
  ```

  where `./.tekton/` is the default location to search pipelines.

* Add task to multiple locations:

  ```bash
  pmt add-task sast-coverity-check \
    /path/to/repo1/pipeline.yaml /path/to/repo2/pipeline-run.yaml ...
  ```

* Specify alternative task bundle explicitly:

  ```bash
  pmt add-task --bundle-ref quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/task-sast-coverity-check:0.1@sha256:... \
    sast-coverity-check \
    /path/to/repo1/pipeline.yaml /path/to/repo2/pipeline-run.yaml ...
  ```

Get more information by `pmt add-task -h`

### To modify Konflux pipelines with `modify`

Sub-command `modify` provides rich options to modify existing pipeline/pipeline runs YAML files,
mainly for automatic migrations.
This command is designed to do as minimal as possible changes to the file,
making the minimal git diff output, compared for example with `yq -i` command that may change
the structure of the whole YAML file.

pipeline-migration-tool (`pmt` command) is configured in Konflux Mintmaker to allow usage in migrations.

* Example of adding new parameter:

with yq (discouraged):

```bash
  yq -i "(.spec.tasks[] | select(.name == \"sast-coverity-check\")).params += \
    [{\"name\": \"image-url\", \"value\": \"$image_url_value\"}]" "$pipeline_file"
```

the same with `pmt modify`:

```bash
  pmt modify -f "$pipeline_file" task sast-coverity-check add-param image-url "$image_url_value"
```

Get more information about supported resources by `pmt modify -h`, and supported commands
for the given resource by `pmt modify RESOURCE -h` (for example `pmt modify task -h`).

#### Known issues

Subcommand `modify` has following known issues

* Indentation of inline comment may not be preserved when value on the same line us updated
Example when value change:

```yaml
key: value  # comment
```

```yaml
key: replaced-value      # comment
```

* YAML Flow style has limited support, to ensure safe modification,
 flow style will be regenerated to block style on affected keys.

For example, adding item `{"item": "test"}` into flow style list:

```yaml
---
start:
  flow: [{item: one, ...}, {item: two, ...}]
```

will result into:

```yaml
---
start:
  flow:
  - {item: one, ...}
  - {item: two, ...}
  - item: test
```

## Run tests

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements-test.txt
tox
```

## Integration test

pipeline-migration-tool relies on task bundles are annotated and migrations are attached properly.
This integration test sets up a testing environment, inside which tasks are built and pushed by the
`build-and-push.sh` script.

Prerequisite:

- A local clone of [konflux-ci/build-definitions](https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions) 
  and checkout to `main` branch.
- Create public image repositories `task-clone` and `task-lint` under specified `QUAY_NAMESPACE`.
- Log into Quay.io in order to make `tkn-bundle-push` work.

For different test scenarios, the task bundles can be customized by setting `RECIPE` environment
variable for `hack/integration-test/setup.sh`. A recipe is a multi-lines text and each line consists
of three fields in order, task name, task version, and marker indicating whether the task bundle
build should have a migration. For example:

```bash
RECIPE="
clone 0.3 M
lint 0.3 -
"
```

Example steps to run the test:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .

git checkout -b <test branch>  # setup.sh commits changes to the repo

# Empty the image repositories of task-clone and task-lint

BUILD_DEFS_REPO="<absolute path to build-definitions>" \
QUAY_NAMESPACE="<quay namespace passed to build-definitions/hack/build-and-push.sh>" \
./hack/integration-test/setup.sh

cd ./hack/integration-test/app
PMT_LOCAL_TEST=1 pmt migrate -u "$(cat /tmp/pmt-test-upgrades.txt)"

# Check if the tool works as expected.
```
